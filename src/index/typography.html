    <p>
      Typography is very important. It’s the only element that speaks to
      both sides of the brain. It has to be both beautiful and legible.
      Typograpy is what conveys our message and outputs our users content.
      As the UI of Wunderlsit continues to take the backseat, we have to
      call on other elements like typography to help carry on our
      character. Lato does this very well. It has a playful but structured
      nature. It has a great x-height is makes reading a breeze and looks
      great on all our platforms.

      Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by
      Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in
      Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the
      open-source Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support
      from Google.
